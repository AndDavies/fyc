"The journey to self-mastery begins in the physical province because that is the easiest place to impart the essential lessons of success and to absorb them."

Key Takeaways for Your Journey to Self-Mastery:
- Growth lives outside your comfort zone. Don’t be afraid to look like a beginner.
- Start small and build up. If 20 minutes of meditation feels impossible, start with five.
- Accept humility as a gift. Every moment of awkwardness is a chance to learn.
- Surrender to what you can’t control. Trust the process, whether it’s a workout or a prayer.

<strong>Years ago</strong>, I came across this quote from Greg Glassman. I don’t remember the exact day, but I remember how it hit me. At that point, I was a few years into recovery, a dedicated CrossFitter, and had even stepped into the role of a coach. I’d conquered some big feats in ultra-running, organized a Sunday morning trail-running group rooted in a shared ethos, and had made significant strides forward. Yet what mattered more than my physical accomplishments was the shift from being an unfit, self-centered, insecure mess to someone who could finally appreciate growth and community. Sure, I’d always had a good heart, but for years I had been completely lost.

Recovery was the first pivotal step. It was a spiritual journey for a spiritually sick person, and it was anything but smooth. I tripped, fell, and struggled to establish routines. Meditation felt impossible. Prayers seemed to go unanswered. I wrestled with the spiritual growth I so desperately wanted. Then, this quote hit me like a ton of bricks.

All the lessons I had internalized up to that point had come from physical accomplishments or moments of being humbled. The gym became my proving ground. You see, the thing about fitness is that feedback is immediate. You can’t fake it.

One day, I’d crush a workout full of running and heavy deadlifts, feeling like an absolute beast. The next day? Gymnastics and Olympic lifting would make me move like Bambi on ice—uncoordinated, awkward, and far from graceful. It was dejecting. But I kept showing up. Slowly, movements improved. I became more coordinated, more confident, more precise. I moved toward virtuosity, only to face new challenges every single day. But I loved it. Even the humbling days were, in their own way, fun.

That’s when the quote truly came alive for me: Growth doesn’t happen in your comfort zone. If you want to improve, you have to try new things. You have to be willing to look like a fool and embrace being bad at something. Over time, I became less self-conscious. I embraced failure in front of others because I had a coach guiding me and a community cheering me on. That experience gave me a strategy I could carry into every area of my life, especially my spiritual path.

Can’t meditate for 20 minutes? Start with five. Racing, squirrel-brained thoughts that won’t stop? That’s the whole point. Your mind is a muscle—work it, build it. Every attempt is a step toward self-mastery. And here’s the kicker: those lessons are only available if you step out of your comfort zone and keep at it.

This new perspective even transformed my spiritual journey and how I saw God. The concept of surrender became a cornerstone: surrendering to a higher power, accepting life on its own terms, and letting go of the idea that the world revolved around me. God became whatever source of strength was greater than my ego. I had a choice: live isolated in my small, lonely world of comfort or step into a larger world full of challenges, opportunities, and community.

It was in physical accomplishments that I first learned to surrender: to instruction, to the intent of a workout, to the reality that I wouldn’t master everything. Growth came from being humble, staying teachable, and being open to learning. Those physical lessons trickled into every part of my life, making me healthier, more humble, and more adaptable.

Now, I strive to be someone willing to learn, someone who doesn’t only do what comes easy. It’s not about being a critical know-it-all but about showing up, being open, and embracing the process. Self-mastery isn’t a destination; it’s a continuous journey. And the most beautiful part? There’s always a new lesson waiting or a chance to lift someone else along their own journey.

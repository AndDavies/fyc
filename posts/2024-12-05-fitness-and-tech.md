With a foundation in naval engineering and a drive for early retirement through aggressive investing, I have set my sights on a new chapter that merges my technical expertise with a commitment to fitness and digital innovation. My journey from the naval world to web development is a testament to the power of persistence and lifelong learning.

After a successful career in naval engineering, I discovered a passion for fitness, CrossFit, and running, all while developing digital solutions that reflect these interests. I've explored building apps that encourage healthy habits, worked on cybersecurity projects, and have deployed personal websites that integrate my coding adventures with my active lifestyle. From developing AI-powered fitness apps to managing the complexities of web technology, this is a story of balance between physical and digital realms.

Whether itâ€™s about creating efficient code, designing workout plans, or investing wisely for the future, I aim to build and share tools that enable better living through technology and wellness.
